# Installation

To install `haplo`, use

```shell
pip install haplo
```

Although not required, as is generally good practice for any development project, we highly recommend creating a separate virtual environment for each distinct project. For example, via Conda, creating a virtual environment for a project using `haplo` might look like (be sure to choose a better name)

```
conda create -n project_using_haplo_env python=3.11
```

Then before working, be sure to activate your environment with

```shell
conda activate project_using_haplo_env
```

Then install `haplo` within this environment.
